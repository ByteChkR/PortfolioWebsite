                                <p>Hello im Tim Akermann a 21 year old game engineering and development student from germany currently studying in the netherlands.I am programming since 9 years and specialized on mathematics and computer science in my highschool years. At the moment I am studying at the Saxion University of applied sciences in enschede. I worked on a bunch of team projects(mostly games) and private projects(mostly tools for games/game development)  overwhelmingly in C# and C++.

In addition to my programming experience I can offer a lot of theoretical knowledge about software development. In my 3 years of abitur specialized in mathematics and computer science, I learned a lot of theoretical concepts and ways to improve productivity/program performance. </p>

                        <p>The game gobble run was the longest project I have worked on and probably the project that I spent the most effort. The engine is written in C++. The game is an level based running game. The player is a Turkey that needs to rescure his wife from the evil chef introduced in the beginning. The game was one of the hardest/most interesting problems I have faced until now. The project was done over a course of 5 weeks. But since everyone was really excited to work on a game for that long period of a time, we had the basic game idea 1 week before the project starts, so we had some proof of concept when officially starting the projects.The game was really positively received from mot of the people we were talking to. And this was probably the game where I had still fun playing the game after 4 weeks of extensive working on that game. <a href="resources/gobblerunreadme.html" target="_blank">Link To readme</a></p>

                        <p>The repository ProjectCPP-tools contains a map editor for Gobble Run.
		In addition to be able to create maps in less than 30 seconds, all the shader parameters are editable in the editor.
		The editor has been changed according to the whishes from designers to better fit their way of working. The editor has a total of 8 releases that were all deployed within the timeframe of the project.</p>
